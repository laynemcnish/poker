# Poker Hand Evaluator
___

In it's current state, the poker hand evaluator is one class that evaluates and scores a hand of cards.

Since I wrote the original evaluator, I have:
- Separated the evaluating and scoring so that each method is responsible for fewer tasks
- Simplified and refactored duplicated code
- Combined the methods that previously were looking for cards of the same suit or value
- Implemented tests

___

Later, I would like to:
- Separate card evaluation and scoring into separate classes
- Create a Game class to show the outcome of multiple people playing
- Create a command line game to allow people to play against friends or the computer

Have a great day!
